Feminine is an initiative through which we want to build an all-in-one women health platform, which diagnoses women specific health issues and help raise awareness for its treatment and management. With a lot of fear of the stigma associated with reproductive health services, women often avoid making use of such services. This stigma imposes a great deal of mental stress, fear, and depression on patients and causes delays in the diagnosis and treatment of their conditions. Through Feminine, we aim at solving this barrier for women to connect with doctor and try to reduce the errors and hassle in the diagnosis of the ailments.

## Machine Learning Tools

### Breast Cancer Prediction Tool

In order to detect cancer, a pathologist examines the slide of tissue under a microscope. S/he visually ensures that there's no cancer and ultimately find malignant areas. We currently provide a tool powered by artifical intelligence which analyses hispathological image i.e. images of glass tissue slides under a microscope, here tissue samples from lymph nodes in order to detect breast cancer. We will be analysing tissues for:

* **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma** - This is the most common subtype of all breast cancers. Almost 80% of diagnosed breast cancers are of this subtype.
* **Metastatic Cancer** - A metastatic cancer or metastatic tumor is one that has spread from the site where it started into different area/s of the body.

We  use the 'Breast Histopathology Images' dataset available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection.

* **IDC_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.88
    * F1 Score: 0.88

* **Metastatic_model** 
    * Accuracy: 0.94
    * F1 Score: 0.94
    
## Cervical Cancer Risk Classification Tool
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix — the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It isn't clear what causes cervical cancer, but it's certain that HPV plays a role. HPV is very common, and most people with the virus never develop cancer. This means other factors — such as your environment or your lifestyle choices — also determine whether you'll develop cervical cancer.

On the basis of these factors that you may answer about in our form below, we inform you whether you are at risk of cervical cancer or not. We facilitate this by providing predictions for four cervical cancer tests, which may be quite expensive otherwise.

We're using the [UCI's Machine Learning repository's Cervical cancer (Risk Factors) Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cervical+cancer+%28Risk+Factors%29). The dataset was collected at 'Hospital Universitario de Caracas' in Caracas, Venezuela. The dataset comprises demographic information, habits, and historic medical records.

* **Schiller test** - Schiller's test or Schiller's Iodine test is a medical test in which iodine solution is applied to the cervix in order to diagnose cervical cancer. Our model uses the following attributes

### Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) Risk Assessment

PCOS or Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome is a hormonal disorder causing enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges. The cause of polycystic ovary syndrome isn't well understood, but may involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The dataset for PCOS is a real-time data set that taken from a survey conducted among 119 women between the ages of 18 and 22. The dataset is primarily based on their lifestyle and food intake habits. The symptoms i.e. attributes are classified based on classification algorithms to predict whether the patient may have PCOS or not available [here](https://github.com/PCOSSurvey/PCOSData).

The model we've made has the following attributes:

|Category|Value|
|-|-|
|Model|VotingEnsemble|
|Ensembled Algorithms|'GradientBoosting', 'LightGBM', 'XGBoostClassifier', 'GradientBoosting', 'ExtremeRandomTrees', 'LogisticRegression'|

|Average Precision Score Weighted|0.98|
|Accuracy|0.96|
